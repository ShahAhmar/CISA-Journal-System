# Journal Management System - User Guide

This guide explains how to use the Journal Management System for managing academic publications, submissions, reviews, and editorial workflows.

## Getting Started

### Creating an Account

To begin using the system, you need to create an account. Visit the registration page and provide your personal information including your full name, email address, and a secure password. After completing the registration form, you will receive a confirmation email.

Once registered, you can log in using your email address and password. The system will automatically redirect you to the appropriate dashboard based on your assigned role.

### Understanding Your Dashboard

After logging in, you will see a dashboard specific to your role. The dashboard displays important information such as pending tasks, submission statistics, and quick access to common actions. Each role has a different dashboard tailored to their responsibilities.

## User Roles

The system supports several user roles, each with specific permissions and responsibilities.

**Site Administrator**: Manages the entire system, creates journals, assigns journal managers, and handles system-wide settings. Site administrators have view-only access to submissions and cannot perform editorial actions.

**Journal Manager**: Manages a specific journal, assigns roles to users, configures journal settings, and has full editorial control including final approval and publishing decisions.

**Editor**: Handles daily editorial workflow, assigns reviewers, makes editorial decisions, and manages submissions through all stages of the review process.

**Section Editor**: Similar to Editor but limited to submissions within their assigned section. Can assign reviewers and make recommendations to the main editor.

**Author**: Submits articles, uploads revisions when requested, approves copyedited files and galleys, and communicates with editors through the system.

**Reviewer**: Reviews assigned submissions, provides recommendations, and submits review reports. Reviewers cannot see author information and cannot approve or move submissions.

**Copyeditor**: Works on accepted articles only, uploads copyedited files, and adds notes. Copyeditors cannot approve or move submissions.

**Proofreader**: Reviews final files before publication, uploads proofread files. Proofreaders cannot approve submissions.

**Reader**: Can register, login, and download published articles. Cannot submit or review articles.

## Submitting an Article

### Initial Submission

To submit a new article, navigate to the journal where you want to submit. Click the Submit Article button to begin the submission process. You will be guided through a multi-step form.

The submission process includes selecting the appropriate journal section, entering article metadata such as title, abstract, and keywords, uploading your manuscript file, adding co-authors if applicable, and reviewing all details before final submission.

After completing the submission, you will see a confirmation page and receive an email confirmation with your submission details. Your role will automatically change from Reader to Author when you submit your first article.

### Viewing Your Submissions

You can view all your submissions from the Author Dashboard. Each submission shows its current status and stage in the editorial process. Click on any submission to view detailed information including editor comments, review status, file attachments, and activity log.

### Uploading Revisions

When an editor requests revisions, you will receive an email notification. To upload revised files, go to your submissions list, click on the submission requiring revision, navigate to the Revision section, upload your revised manuscript file, add any comments explaining the changes made, and submit the revision. The system will notify the editor when your revision is uploaded.

## Reviewing Articles

### Receiving Review Invitations

When an editor assigns you to review a submission, you will receive an email invitation containing the article title, abstract, and a link to accept or decline the review.

### Initial Review Decision

Upon receiving an invitation, you must first decide whether to accept or decline the review. Click the link in the invitation email or access the review from your dashboard. Review the article abstract and submission details. You can view non-author metadata such as keywords and submission date. Choose Accept Review or Decline Review.

If you accept, you proceed to the review process. If you decline, you will be removed from the review assignment.

### Performing the Review

Once you accept a review, you can access the review interface. Download the anonymized manuscript files. Author information is automatically removed to maintain double-blind review standards.

Read the manuscript carefully and prepare your review. Complete the review form by adding your comments in the text area, uploading an annotated file if you have made specific annotations, and selecting your recommendation from the dropdown menu. Recommendation selection is mandatory.

Available recommendations include Accept, Revisions Required, Resubmit, Resubmit Elsewhere, Decline, and See Comments.

Submit your review. You will see a confirmation message, and the editor will be notified automatically.

### Reviewer Restrictions

As a reviewer, you can only view and review assigned submissions, download anonymized files, and submit review recommendations. You cannot see author information, see other reviewers or their comments, approve or reject submissions, or move submissions between stages.

## Managing Submissions as an Editor

### Accessing Submissions

Editors have access to all submissions in their journal. From the editor dashboard, you can see submissions organized by stage and status. Section Editors will only see submissions from their assigned sections.

### Viewing Submission Details

Click on any submission to view comprehensive details including article metadata, author information, all uploaded files, review assignments and recommendations, activity log, and discussion threads.

### Assigning Reviewers

To assign a reviewer to a submission, open the submission details page, navigate to the Reviewers section, click Assign Reviewer, search for reviewers by name or expertise, select the reviewer, and send the invitation. The reviewer will receive an email invitation, and you can track their response and review status.

### Making Editorial Decisions

Editors can make several types of decisions. Accept Submission moves the article to the copyediting stage when the article meets publication standards after review. Reject Submission is used when the article does not meet standards, and you should provide clear reasons for rejection.

Desk Reject is used for submissions that clearly do not fit the journal scope or have fundamental issues, and this happens before sending to review. Request Revision is used when the article needs changes before acceptance. The author will receive notification and can upload revised files.

Publish is used after all stages are complete and approvals are in place. You can assign the article to an issue and set page numbers.

### Contacting Authors

You can send emails directly to authors from the submission page. Click Contact Author, enter your message, and the author will receive an email notification.

### Final Approving Copyediting

After the author approves copyedited files, you need to give final approval. Open the submission in copyediting stage, verify that the author has approved the copyedited files, click Final Approve Copyedit, and the submission automatically moves to the proofreading stage. Only Journal Managers and Section Editors can perform final approval.

## Copyediting Workflow

### Accessing Copyediting Tasks

Copyeditors can only work on articles that have been accepted. From your dashboard, you will see a list of accepted articles assigned to you for copyediting.

### Reviewing the Manuscript

Click on a submission from your dashboard. Review the article information and abstract. Download the current manuscript files. Review the activity log to understand the submission history.

### Uploading Copyedited Files

After reviewing and editing the manuscript, click Upload Copyedited File, select your edited file in PDF, DOC, or DOCX format, add any notes about the changes you made, and upload the file. The system will automatically notify the author and editors that copyedited files are ready for review.

### Copyeditor Restrictions

As a copyeditor, you can view accepted articles assigned to you, download manuscript files, upload copyedited files, and add notes. You cannot work on articles that are not accepted, approve or reject submissions, move submissions between stages, or make editorial decisions.

## Proofreading Workflow

### Accessing Proofreading Tasks

Proofreaders work on articles in the proofreading stage. From your dashboard, you will see submissions that need proofreading.

### Reviewing Files

Open a submission from your dashboard. Review all available files. Check for typos, formatting errors, and other issues. Download files as needed for review.

### Uploading Proofread Files

After completing your proofreading, click Upload Proofread File, select your proofread file, add notes about corrections made, and upload the file. The system will notify relevant parties that proofreading is complete.

### Proofreader Restrictions

As a proofreader, you can view submissions in proofreading stage, download files, upload proofread files, and add notes. You cannot approve submissions, make editorial decisions, or contact authors directly.

## Copyedit Approval Process

### For Authors

After copyediting is complete, you will receive an email notification. To review and approve copyedited files, open the submission from your dashboard, navigate to the Copyediting section, download and review the copyedited file, and choose one of the following options.

If the copyediting is satisfactory, click Approve. The file will be sent to the editor for final approval. If you need modifications, click Request Changes, enter your comments explaining what needs to be changed, and submit. The copyeditor will review your comments and make necessary adjustments.

### For Editors

After the author approves copyedited files, a Journal Manager or Section Editor must give final approval. This moves the submission to the proofreading stage. The Final Approve Copyedit button will appear in the submission details page when the author has approved the files.

## Galley Production Workflow

### Uploading Galleys

Editors or Production Editors can upload galley files in multiple formats. PDF format is for printing and download, HTML format is for web display, and XML format is for indexing and archiving.

To upload a galley, open the submission in production stage, click Upload Galley, select the galley type, enter a label if needed, and upload the file. The system notifies the author and editors that galleys are ready.

### Author Galley Approval

The author must review and approve each galley format. Download and review each galley. For each galley, you can either approve if the galley is correct, or request changes by clicking Request Changes, entering specific comments about what needs modification, and submitting. All galleys must be approved before the article can be published.

### Final Publishing

After all galleys are approved and copyediting is complete, a Journal Manager or Section Editor can final publish the article. Open the submission, click Final Publish, optionally assign to an issue, set page numbers if applicable, and confirm publication. The article is now published and available to readers.

## Discussion Threads

Discussion threads allow communication between authors, editors, and reviewers about specific submissions.

### Creating a Discussion Thread

To start a new discussion, open the submission page, navigate to the Discussion section, click Create New Thread, enter a title and optional description, and submit to create the thread.

### Adding Comments

To add a comment to an existing thread, open the discussion thread, scroll to the comment box, enter your comment. If you are an editor, you can mark the comment as Internal to make it visible only to editors. Submit your comment. All participants will receive email notifications when new comments are added.

### Managing Threads

Editors can lock or unlock discussion threads to control participation. Locked threads prevent new comments but allow viewing of existing comments. Use the Lock or Unlock button in the thread header.

## Email Notifications

The system sends automatic email notifications for various events. You will receive an email when you submit a new article, when you are assigned as a reviewer, when a review is completed, when copyedited files are ready, when galleys are ready, when an article is scheduled for publication, and when new comments are added to discussion threads.

All notifications include relevant links to access the submission or take required actions. Make sure your email address in your profile is correct to receive these notifications.

## SMTP Configuration
