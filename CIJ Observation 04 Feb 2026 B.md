FUNCTIONALITY



1. &nbsp;Author is still not able to submit a manuscript (both on web and Mobile). " make submitting easy to attract more submissions." Author should click on submit, then system ask to fill in info, then upload file, then click submit. at this stage system asks user to input user name and password for profile creation. after this is done user click approve. then payment pops up and ask user to chose options to pay the 25$ submission fees. after this the manuscript is submited. 
2. After submission, Admin see the manuscript and payment then she/he clisck on check Plagirism. the result for each  plagiarism check is displayed on both admin and on author/user portal. 
3. User can update and resubmit for plagirism check again.

7. GIVE Admin Previllage to update all user credetianls (User name and Password)
8. Allow user to user phone numbers as user name because most user dont have email address. 
9. &nbsp; Allow Admin to make Submissions of articles and by pass all review process. admin can publish a manuscript / article from any stage of process review.
10. I am unable to locate the plagiarism check feature within the Admin Portal
11. Remember to add communication tools for Admin staff to comunicate with users/ Authors.
12. Please add a prominent Plagiarism Check button to the homepage and other key pages. We should offer this as a standalone service for users who aren't looking to submit or publih with us. Implement a pay-per-use model (e.g., $20) that allows users to run a single scan and download/print their results.
